# test_map.py
#
# Used to test the mr.py library's Map function.
#
# The program has two parameters: n, and cluster_size, defined in the first
# two lines of code.  The program sets up a distributed dictionary with
# 1 through n as keys, and then uses a Map job, running on cluster_size
# machines, to square everything in the dictionary.
